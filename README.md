# C++ Repository

Welcome to my repository. This is a collection of files written in C++ that explore various concepts and ideas that can be used for reference or fun. 

### Compiling Files

Most of these files are ready to be compiled and used for the end-user. You can compile these files by running the following command within Linux:
```
g++ <name-of-cpp-file> -o <name-of-your-choice-for-executable>
```
The name of the executable can be anything you want. You can also run the command as `g++ <name-of-file>` without the `-o` flag in which case the name of the executable will be `a.out`. 

If there are multiple files within a folder, you will want to compile the `main.cpp` file. To execute the file, simply run the command:
```
./a.out OR ./<name-of-cpp-file>
```
